-It is a project in which learning and testing stages are applied with Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression,                                                       
Artificial Neural Network model algorithms after data preparation, feature elimination and normalization processes.

-The results of the test phase were presented with confusion matrix to evaluate.

-Evaluation and data interpretations are in the report.
